# FrozenLake-played-by-Reinforcement-Q-Learning-Agent
A simple program where the 'Agent' plays the Frozen Lake game environment. The 'Agent' tries to maximize it's rewards using Q Learning.

## Discounted Rewards:
For continuous 'Actions' we use a Discounted reward system, so that the Agent prioritizes the present reward rather than some future reward.

where Î³(gamma) is the discounted value

## Bellman Equation for Optimality:

We use the Bellman equation to find the optimal 'q' value
